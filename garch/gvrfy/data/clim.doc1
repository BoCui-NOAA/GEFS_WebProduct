   The climatology that is being used in the anomaly correlations that
Yuejian Zhu calculates and Pete Caplan tabulates for the Northern
Hemisphere is an old 15-year data set from about 1951-1965, consisting
only of 1000-mb and 500-mb heights The data used in the Southern
Hemisphere are more recent (1980's, we think) but consist only of an
8-year record.  For the tropics, the data set used comes from a 23-year
reanalysis.
