   The climatology that is being used in the anomaly correlations that
Yuejian Zhu calculates and Pete Caplan tabulates for the Northern
Hemisphere is an old 15-year data set from about 1951-1965, consisting
only of 1000-mb and 500-mb heights The data used in the Southern
Hemisphere are more recent (1980's, we think) but consist only of an
8-year record.  For the tropics, the data set used comes from a 23-year
reanalysis. 
   Since the choice of climatology has a noticeable effect on anomaly
correlations, an effect that varies from day to day, it is important for
the evaluation of test runs to make sure that you use the same climatology
for experiment and control and not to attempt to compare your scores to
those calculated elsewhere.
   Another issue is smoothness and the length of record.  It is desirable
that a good climatology smooth out the natural short-term fluctuations in
atmospheric circulation.  This is not guaranteed if the period of
averaging is not too short. A climatology of roughly 30 years seems to be
the traditional choice. 
   Therefore we recommend that, for evaluating your experiments with Mr.
Zhu's package, you select a recent reanalysis climatolgy.  As for the
"official" historical statistics, they will still be calculated with the
same climatology to guarantee consistency.
