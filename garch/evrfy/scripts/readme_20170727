Scripts VRFY_CMC_16m_ahgt.sh and VRFY_CMC_16m_f20060530.sh are not working anymore after system migration from CCS to WCOSS.
This is because the excutables cannot generated by sorc/makefile_VRFY_cmc16m_a20060530 and sorc/makefile_VRFY_cmc16m_f20060530. In the source code,two functions durand and isortx are from IBM library on CCS, which are no longer available anymore on WCOSS.As a result, the score files SCORESm.* cannot be genertaed in ~/evrfy and ~/evfscoresdirectories.
